- I'm a Cornell University Junior Studying Computer Science and Economics.

- Currently, I'm a TA for CS 3410 (computer systems organization and programming), an Economics Research Assistant, and helping build one of the world's first collegiate Liquid Rocketry Teams
- I recently completed a summer internship at Meta where I learned about full stack development and fintech and capped the experience off with the "EconMetrics" project.
- I've previously worked with Professor Ken Birman on the Cascade system where I predominately write low-latency C++. Some other things I've done in the past include software engineering for the Ruminant Farm Systems Model with the USDA and being a teaching assistant for CS2800 (discrete structures).
- I'm interested in compilers, embedded systems, algorithms, statistics, game theory, behavioral economics, macroeconomics, and econometrics.
- I'm most interested in low-level programming, using languages like C, and C++, And sometimes Assembly / Verilog. But I also enjoy using Python, Java, and OCaml among others.
- Feel free to reach out if you'd like to work together on something! I can be reached at ctw54@cornell.edu

- I'm a Cornell University Senior Studying Computer Science and Economics.
- I've interned twice at Meta (summers 2024 /2025). My work has spanned full-stack development (see: EconMetrics and distributed systems. I'll be returning full-time in June 2026!
- I'm an Economics Research Assistant, advised by Professor Ryan Chahrour. My research interests are primarily in behavioral New Keynesian models. In practice, that means I do data manipulation/replication in MATLAB, and I read a lot of papers.
- My main CS interests are PL/Compilers and Systems type work (OS, Distributed), but I love solving all kinds of problems.
- Feel free to reach out if you'd like to work together on something! I can be reached at ctw54@cornell.edu

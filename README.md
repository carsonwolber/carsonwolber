- I'm a Cornell University Sophomore Studying Computer Science and Economics. I have done Software Engineering for the Ruminant Farm Systems Model with the USDA and been a Teaching Assistant for CS2800 (Discrete Structures).
- Some of the things I'm interested in are compilers, embedded systems programming, algorithms, programming languages, functional programming, statistics, game theory, behavioral economics, and econometrics.
- I'm still figuring out my exact career path, but I'm mainly interested in jobs in quantitative analysis/development and high-frequency trading since they combine the two subjects I'm most interested in.
- I see myself as being more inclined to low-level programming, using languages like C, and C++, and I'm not afraid of Assembly when necessary. But I also really enjoy using Python, Java, and OCaml among others.
- Feel free to reach out if you'd like to work together on something! I can be reached at ctw54@cornell.edu
